<h1>Odin Recipes Website Project</h1>
<p>This is the recipes website project for the Odin Project, built only with HTML, for practicing.</p>

I will make use of the HTML knowledge I have acquired up until now to create a simple website with a functioning homepage, relative and absolute links, lists and embedded images.
