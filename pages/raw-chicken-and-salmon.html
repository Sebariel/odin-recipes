    <div class="box6 ul">
      <ul>
        <li>700g raw chicken wings (bone-in, skin-on)</li>
        <li>100g raw salmon (with bone)</li>
        <li>100g raw chicken heart</li>
        <li>50g raw beef kidney</li>
        <li>50g raw chicken liver</li>
        <li>1 whole egg, raw (with shell)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon taurine supplement</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="inst3">Instructions</h3>
    <div class="box7 ol">
      <ol>
        <li>Cut the salmon and organ meats into chunks that will fit through your meat grinder.</li>
        <li>Divide the chicken wings as needed to fit through the grinder.</li>
       <li>Place a bowl under the grinder and feed the meat and organs through.</li>
        <li>Transfer the ground mixture to a large bowl then add the taurine, egg, and water to combine.</li>
        <li>Portion out the mixture and freeze or refrigerate.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="p2 center"><strong><i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></strong> Notes: If you donâ€™t have a grinder, you can start by pureeing the organ meats with the egg and water. Cut the chicken wings into pieces and pulse them together with the organ meat puree in a food processor or high-powered blender. If no other option exists, you can chop the ingredients very finely by hand.</p>
