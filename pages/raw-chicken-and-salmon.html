 <h2>Raw, just as nature intended for your cat!</h2>
 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <div class="box">
  <ul>
    <li>700g raw chicken wings (bone-in, skin-on)</li>
    <li>100g raw salmon (with bone)</li>
    <li>100g raw chicken heart</li>
    <li>50g raw beef kidney</li>
    <li>50g raw chicken liver</li>
    <li>1 whole egg, raw (with shell)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon taurine supplement</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
  </ul>
 </div>
 <h3>Instructions</h3>
 <div class="box">
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the salmon and organ meats into chunks that will fit through your meat grinder.</li>
    <li>Divide the chicken wings as needed to fit through the grinder.</li>
    <li>Place a bowl under the grinder and feed the meat and organs through.</li>
    <li>Transfer the ground mixture to a large bowl then add the taurine, egg, and water to combine.</li>
    <li>Portion out the mixture and freeze or refrigerate.</li>
  </ol>
 </div>
 <p><strong>Notes</strong>: If you donâ€™t have a grinder, you can start by pureeing the organ meats with the egg and water. Cut the chicken wings into pieces and pulse them together with the organ meat puree in a food processor or high-powered blender. If no other option exists, you can chop the ingredients very finely by hand.</p>
